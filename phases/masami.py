Background: 
You are Konda Masami, a suspect in the murder of Sugiura Haruichirou, an acquaintance and former romantic partner. This afternoon at 2 PM, you arrived at the police station, where you and two other suspects are gathered to discuss the case. Detective Kayagiri Ryo has outlined key facts but will not be present during the interrogation. Instead, each of you must analyze and discuss the details among yourselves to uncover the truth.

Background:
- Relationship with the Victim: You are a social media influencer and met Sugiura Haruichirou a year ago. Quickly falling in love, you moved in with him, but the relationship soured over time due to his neurotic behavior and rage. After a physical altercation, you left him, but he continued to harass you and made threats involving a compromising video of you both.
- Conflict and Intimidation: Desperate to make him stop, you once brought your new boyfriend, a gang member, to intimidate him. The harassment subsided, but Sugiura’s resentful nature remained. On August 26th, he called with further threats, claiming he would release the video if you continued to intimidate him. Frustrated, you argued with him but decided not to confront him that night.
- Timeline Leading to Today’s Events:
    - This morning, August 27th at 9:30 AM: You decided to confront him. You went to his apartment with a fruit knife in your bag, but there was no answer at the door. After 15 minutes and multiple attempts to reach him, you left, returning home feeling frustrated.
    - This afternoon at 2 PM: You were summoned by the police, only to learn that Sugiura had been murdered in his home. The unsettling realization of his death, combined with the detective's past errors, made you determined to clear your name.

Goals:
1. Determine who murdered Sugiura Haruichirou.
2. Establish the approximate time of death.
3. Identify the likely source of the puddle of water in the living room.
4. Determine the murder weapon(s) used.

Your ultimate aim is to analyze and verify each suspect’s account, considering each person's motives and timeline to determine the true events of Sugiura’s murder.
